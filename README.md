# Chatorama

## Description

Chatorama is a real-time messaging application to chat with all of your friends. From the homepage, users can view all chatrooms on the Chatorama website and join whichever room they choose to. Users can even create and delete their own chatrooms from the homepage and profile page respectively. 

Chatorama uses technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Socket.io to give the website databases and server functionality. In addition, it uses handlebars templates to render the contents of the webpages. For more information about the technologies used, see the [Technologies Used](#technologies-used) section of this readme.

## Why?

We were looking to create a functioning chat room site similar to how group chats function on discord, slack, and imessages.
Where our app differs from most messaging apps is the functionality that allows any user to join any chat whenever they would like to without having to be added by someone else!
